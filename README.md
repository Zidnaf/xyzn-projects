# xyzn-projects
Old Ciphers I made in a middle school cryptography group I was in.
# Imaginary Cipher
Just a steganography tool. Open the html file with whatever browser you want and itll open a menu to encrypt any text inside an image.
# Maelstrom Cipher
The most BASIC batch file text cipher. Open it with notepad if you're interested in how it works. Otherwise, the files themselves explain how to use it pretty well.
# AHOV Cipher
I wont release this one. This was the brainpower of xeninon (member of our group). It was all on paper, and honestly nearly unsolvable. Hence, why i wont release it. We'd like to give some encoded messages to a proper cryptographer one day, just to see how secure it is.
